# â˜• Coffee Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing coffee sales data using Excel with advanced features like Pivot Tables, Power Pivot, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. The goal is to extract actionable insights to optimize business operations, improve sales, and enhance customer experience. The dataset includes sales data segmented by product category, store locations, time of day, and customer preferences.

## ðŸš€ Key Insights

## 1. Top-Selling Products

Coffee is the top-selling category, while Tea and Bakery products offer growth opportunities.
Solution: Implement product bundling strategies and targeted promotions to boost sales in underperforming categories.

## 2. Peak Hours for Orders

Sales peak during morning hours.
Solution: Align staffing and inventory with peak hours to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

## 3. Weekday Sales Trends

Mondays and Fridays experience the highest sales, while midweek days (Tuesday, Wednesday) have lower volumes.
Solution: Introduce special promotions or discounts during slower days to boost sales.

## 4. Store Performance

Stores in Hell's Kitchen and Astoria outperform others, while Lower Manhattan lags.
Solution: Focus marketing and resource optimization efforts on underperforming stores.

## 5. Sales by Size

Regular and large sizes dominate sales.
Solution: Use upselling strategies, like discounts on larger sizes, to increase order values.

## 6. Seasonality in Sales

Sales fluctuate month-to-month, with clear peaks and troughs.
Solution: Implement seasonal promotions during low-demand periods to stabilize revenue.

## 7. Average Bill and Quantity per Order

There's potential to increase the average bill per customer.
Solution: Implement cross-selling and loyalty programs to drive larger orders and higher bills.

## 8. Product Quantity Sold

Coffee leads in terms of quantity sold, while categories like Flavours and Drinking Chocolate show potential for growth.
Solution: Develop strategies to promote lower-selling items through bundling and seasonal offers.
